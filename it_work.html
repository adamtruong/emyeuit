												<br>
												<li>Wake up </li>
												<li>Eat breakfast 
												<li>Go to work. 
												<li>Online meeting to discuss work 
												<li>Start coding 
												<li>Hard, go to Stackoverflow for an answer.

												So, most of the day, he spent time working and doing everything else in the company. Most people he meets in a day are through the screen of his laptop because they work from home or another state. The challenge of this job is that your teammate may be in a different place or country so that it is pretty challenging to meet and discuss face-to-face. Therefore, decision-making and solving problems may not be fast and efficient.

												Name: Justin Hammond <br>
												Place: Lehi, Utah<br>
												Work at: Silicon Slopes<br>
												<br>
												<li>Wake up and check for the baby </li>
												<li>Get a good breakfast. </li>
												<li>Prep for work </li>
												<li>Check GitHub to see if someone has opened an issue and then respond to them. </li>
												<li>Check email to see if any team member has pushed code that needs review. </li>
												<li>Code review time: Check if the coworker has submitted and left feedback. This is important because if the code has a bug and you use that code, it can cause damage </li>
												<li>Check feedback for my code, then deal with the problem. They noticed me and resubmitted the code again </li>
												<li>Check if there are any jobs still available to do on the board </li>
												<li>Start with a simple task </li>
												<li>Done with family matters </li>
												<li>Take lunch with his baby </li>
												<li>Go back to work </li>
												<li>Online meeting to discuss what each person did and plans to and any issues that arise while performing tasks </li>
												<li>Back to coding: building an internal tool that will help us facilitate working faster as a team. Someday make customer-facing features </li>
												<li>Work on various categories: features, bug fixes, scripts, databases, internal tools, documentation </li>
												<li>Take a short break </li>
												<li>More meetings </li>
												<li>Pair programming: team up with another member to watch and learn. This is very important, so he tried to do this as often as possible. </li>
												<li>Standing up after sitting too long and finishing the rest of the work by checking emails, slack messages, submitting code reviews and closing all finished tasks </li>
												<li>Double-check again </li>
												<li>Finish work. After that, eat dinner with the family, watch shows, and walk around the house<br>
												<br>
	He spends most of the time inside his house because he works from home to look after the baby. In the morning, he doesn’t do much coding. Most of the time is spent checking emails, coworker codes, and addressing the problems with his code that his coworker has pointed out. It's mostly on GitHub and emails. When all of the issues have been dealt with, he will check for any tasks that he can do on the board anstart with something simple. Then, come noon, he goes out to take the baby to the doctor for a checkup and follows that by having lunch. When the lunch is finished, he gets back to work and starts by having a meeting with his coworkers to discuss what they did and the plan for future tasks. After the meeting, he returns to coding for an internal tool the team will use. His job can involve various categories: features, bug fixes, scripts, databases, internal tools, documentation. He takes a short break to prep for the next meet when the device is done. After that, he pairs with a coworker to see each other code and learn about freaceach person’s experience the day; he will finish the rest of the tasks while standing for an extended time. Double-check all of his emails and messages, then close all open tasks. For the evening, he eats dinner with his family and watches shows. The challenge of this job is that you need to have various knowledge about computers, such as link websites, bug fixes, documental, and coding, to do the work smoothly and be in charge of projects with others. Also, having to sit before the monitor for 8-9 hours straight, it is predicted that health problems, including eye strain and backache, will be challenging for a Software Engineer like Justin. This is why working out or going jogging in the morning has become a new trend among IT Engineers to keep fit and healthy.

											<br>
											<br>
											In the day, most of his activities occur in his workplace, but his day concentrates on coding and other exercises for his physical and mental health. This job required various knowledge about frontend and backend languages. Also, people need to be creative to give out a new idea for each new website, have high problem-solving skills, identify and analyse the need of customers and trends, and be good at communication.

											<br>
											He spends most of the time inside his house because he works from home, but he does other activities and improves himself through reading books or physical exercises. He starts his day quite early to maximise his time management. I think the challenge of this job is you need to manage your time so that you can separate job efficiency and balance between working and doing exercise to gain good health.

										<h2>DAY IN THE LIFE OF A JAPANESE GAME PROGRAMMER </h2>

												(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_TxH59MclA)<br>
												<br>
												Name: Masa<br>
												Place: Tokyo, Japan<br>
												Work at: Bandai Namco Studio<br>											
												<br>
												<li>Wake up at 8:15 am </li>
												<li>Personal hygiene</li>
												<li>Dress up (need 5 to 10 minutes)</li>
												<li>Go to work at around 9:10 am by train</li>
												<li>Before he starts to work, he continuously checks his email and the internal company’s social network and has a quick breakfast.</li>
												<li>Start coding about game</li>
												<li>At noon, he has lunch with his colleagues</li>
												<li>He comes back to work at 1:00 pm</li>
												<li>He finishes up his tasks at 6:00 pm
												<br>
												<br>
												He always wakes up between 8 am to 8:20 am and then does personal hygiene. He goes to work by underground train, which is typical in Japan. The first thing he does when coming to his company is to check his email and the internal company’s social network and has a quick breakfast with a juice box and a calorie bar. He spends most of his time coding, sharing and discussing the upcoming game project with his colleagues. At noon he has lunch and comes back to work at 1 pm. He finishes his work at 6 pm, and then he hangs out and has dinner with his friends. Coming up with new game ideas is the biggest challenge for game programmers. Gamers are always eager to experience something out of this world, so game programmers have to spend a lot of time brainstorming new features constantly. Just one repetitive factor will flop the game, so game programmers might also be a bit stressed.

												<br>
												<li>He goes to work at 8:45 am by bus</li>
												<li>He has his breakfast at the workplace with his colleagues</li>
												<li>After that, he has an interview with other new people</li>
												<li>Start coding (about security)
												</li>
												<li>Have some lunch</li>
												<li>Head back to work</li>
												<li>Have a break (coffee and play table tennis)</li>
												<li> Deploying code</li>
												<li>Pray ASR</li>
												<li>Finish work and go home by underground train
												<br>
												<br>
												He can find exciting things about his job to increase motivation and productivity when coding and discussing new projects with his teammates. Also, he never misses any of asr sessions, even at the company. I think the challenge of this job is that people need to create motivation for themselves because coding about security is complicated and requires massive concentration. The hall system may break down just a tiny error, and if people release it to the public, viruses and hackers can attack.

												<br>
												<li>He wakes up at 6:31 am </li>

												<li>He has a break at 2h35 with a smoothie then come back to work</li>
												<li>He finishes his work at 4:30 pm and heads home
												<br>
												<br>
												He is a person that can balance work and doing sport to gain good heal and have the energy to code and finish workloads at his company. Once again, like most IT workers, he often spends his work time in the office, particularly in front of the computer. As the video suggested, he often interacts with his coworkers and his manager and has a meeting to discuss the source codes and future projects. The environment of his company is an ideal place for a software engineer to work and develop. However, he never put down his computer, even when he takes a break, he still brings his computer with him. Leading to it can affect his eyes and his back. That is why he always do the gym in the early morning before he goes to work to improve and maintain his health.

											<br>
											Name: Shawn Chen<br>
											Place: United States<br>
											Work at: Linkedin<br>
											
											<br>
											<li>He wakes up at 7:30 am with his cat</li>
											<li>Personal hygiene</li>
											<li>At 8:00, he drives to work</li>
											<li>He has breakfast at the company’s canteen at 8:30</li>
											<li>The first thing he does before starting to code is to set up everything and check emails.</li>
											<li>From 10 am to 11 am, he has a meeting with co-workers</li>
											<li>After that, he reviews the code</li>
											<li>At 12:00 he has lunch at the canteen</li>

											<li>Back to work at 2:30 (coding)</li>
											<li>Writing/ Reviewing docs</li>
											<li>At 4:30 pm, he finishes his work </li>
											<li>Play basketball
											<br>
											<br>
											He is a pet lover. He can balance his work, time to take care of his pets and time to do exercise. He has a lot of work to do when returning to the company because of Covid-19. The meeting time increases rapidly as well as the workloads. Because he spends most of his time at the company, so at break time, he rides a bike and plays basketball to improve his physical health and keep fit. The challenge of this job is that you don’t have much time to do exercise so that Shawn Chen needs to use his break time to ride a bike around the company and play basketball to gain good health in order to avoid sickness. Also, people need to be careful with up-to-date information about new jobs and summaries of the main idea of the job so that there will be no mistakes and make job finders get confused.

											<br>
											He goes to work at 7:30 am on Netflix's free shuttle bus. To save time, he starts coding on the bus until he arrives at the office. Then he will have breakfast at the canteen before going to his seat. At 9 am, he continues his work and takes a break at 10:30. He will grab some lunch at 12:30 with his colleagues and go for a walk to digest the food. At 1:30, he will have a meeting with co-workers to discuss the new project and new ideas for upcoming events. He goes back to work at 3 pm and finished at 4 pm. He takes the shuttle bus to go home and still work on the bus. In my opinion, the challenge of this job is that people need to work at the head office no matter what. As you can see, he needs to travel from San Francisco to Los Gatos to work, which take him around more than 1 hour. That’s why he needs to work on the bus to save time and reduce his workload of a day. Moreover, with the distance in terrain and having to take the bus early, he doesn’t have time to do exercise, which can affect his health.
