												<h2>Intro</h2>
												<blockquote>After a lengthy discussion with many ideas and comments that we have given out to each of our project ideas, we decided to choose GetWell - a relaxing mobile app that Viet Long is researching and developing to be our project idea for the assignment. 
												<br><br>We have considered the realistic of the project GetWell and realized that it is not too difficult to complete and it is suitable for us who just starting to learn about technology and the internet of things. 
												<br><br>GetWell is a free-to-use, soothing mobile app that helps people control their sleep and makes sleeping much more accessible. “Sleep is an essential function that allows your body and mind to recharge, leaving you refreshed and alert when you wake up” (Alexa Fry, Dr. Abhinav Singh, Sleep Foundation, 2020). Good sleep is like when we do regular exercise or eat a healthy balanced diet; the more you do, the more benefits you gain. However, “More than 44% of workers in production-focused industries, such as factory workers and plant operators, report getting seven hours of sleep or less per night.” (Eric Suni, Dr. Kimberly Truong, Sleep Foundation, 2021). Sleep deprivation usually comes from the effect of the environment around you or comes from your bad habits, such as uncomfortable bed, overeating at night, not having a reasonable sleep timetable, drinking too much medicine, or absorbing over-limited caffeine. Some of the potential problems caused by sleep loss are high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attack, heart failure, or stroke. It also affects your physical health and mental health, including obesity, depression, anxiety, and psychosis. Realizing that issue, GetWell will help people erase the difficulty of sleeping and melt away the fatigue and stresses of everyone after a busy day.</blockquote>
<h2>Aim and summary</h2>
<blockquote>Every age can use GetWell, but it will focus on seniors between 50 to 70 years old when people usually have insomnia and sleep problems. People have to sign in or register with a new account or phone number to access this app. Lo-fi and relaxing music will be played when you open the app. Then, there will be 3 steps. Each step contains a few questions about yourself to help the app understand your needs. In step 1, there will be 5 questions about yourself: your name, age, gender, and time you usually sleep and wake up. Then in step 2, the app will ask, “Do you have sleep problems”, if Yes, the app will say, “I’m very sorry to hear that” and ask you “How long have you been sleep deprived?” and “Does it happen often”. Then move you to step 3. If you choose No, the app will move you to step 3. In step 3, the app will ask “How can I help you” and pop up 7 boxes (will be updated more) for you to choose, like Relieve stress, Fall asleep, Unwind your brain, Have a short break, Concentrate on your work, Help my kids to sleep, and even Help my pets to relax (unique feature), or All of them. After that, you can choose methods to relax, like: Music, Light exercise, Breathing, Story, Meditation, or All of them. When you finish it, it’s time for you to GetWell Soon.</blockquote>
<h2>Features</h2>
<blockquote>The features of GetWell are you can choose to hear sound and music, like piano, violin, trumpet, rain sound, wind, campfire, thunder, river, waterfalls, and more. The special of this app is that you can mix all the sound together or create your own music with other music apps (Spotify, Soundcloud) and use it on your breathing exercise feature, meditation, story, and light exercise features the app. You can also create your own sleeping schedule, including time for bed and wake up, time for meditation and training, and time for going to work or feeding pets, which will work like an alarm or what to do note. The interface is simple and easy to use, with the primary colour being dark because it will make our eyes feel comfortable, not too bright even when you open the app late at night. You can create your own character, like pianist, violinist, camp boy with a guitar, and more, and interact with users and admin on a public server. Creating your own server is one of the features that make GetWell unique. Inviting your friends and your family, access together, manage worries, quiet your thoughts together, let go of your day, chilling music or doing exercise together, break the ice, feel renewed, and GetWell together.</blockquote>
<h2>Expected Outcome: </h2>
<blockquote>GetWell’s music will emit a gentle and pleasant frequency directly into our brain, making the nerves relax, not tense. At that time, it will cause blood circulation easier, will circulate throughout the body without being compressed in one place. Therefore, it will avoid headaches, wandering thoughts, and stress. The sound of nature combined with the sound of musical instruments will bring people a sense of comfort, making it easy to fall asleep without even knowing it.</blockquote>
<h2>Required</h2>
<blockquote>To make GetWell, Java may be the best language option for me because it is the most used language, and it is also the most supported language by Google. We will use it from Vscode to coding and use Canvas to make the interface and then code it into Java. If it's possible to make this app accurate, we want to cooperate with Ipnos, one of the best wellness app development studios.
<br><br>GetWell required many skills and qualifications to make it and release it to the public. We need to study front-end and back-end languages, such as Python, JavaScript, Java, maybe Swift (for IOS), and we need to understand the basic information when developing a mobile app. Besides coding, knowledge about biology is necessary, especially about the human respiratory system, to deal with sleep loss problems and touch the user’s demands. In short, we need to give our best shot at studying to have enough skills and knowledge to make GetWell come true.</blockquote>
<h2>Difficulties</h2>
<blockquote>As we mentioned before, sleeping loss comes in many ways, so there will probably be times when GetWell won't work and can not make users fall asleep. Moreover, nowadays, there are a lot of sleeping apps that appear and are famous in the world, for example: Relax Melodies, Sleep Cycle, or Recolour, leading to we will have a lot of “big” competitors. Not to mention, we are new in this field, so it will be challenging to promote and dispute customers and markets. However, the chance is still there, as long as we can prove GetWell is different and more unique than other sleeping apps that can actually solve the sleeping loss or make users who have insomnia feel comfortable and improve their sleep.</blockquote>
<h2>End</h2>
<blockquote>The aim of GetWell will not change. It always focuses on helping people cure sleep problems, improve their physical and mental health, and connect people to get well together. If the project is successful, everyone can overcome their issues. The percentages of people who have sleep loss will reduce rapidly; everyone will be positive in the morning to work and live full of energy. 
<br><br>If we have to evaluate and estimate the probability of the whole team to accomplish this idea, we could say that we are confident to archive this project. We have looked through the basics of developing the mobile app as most of GetWell’s functions are easy to be done and run well. However, we are still beginners in this field made it hard to perfect this app and create a friendly user interface. Therefore, we will try our best to complete and make it qualified enough so that everyone can use it to make their lives comfortable. </blockquote>
