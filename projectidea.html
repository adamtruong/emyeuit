												<h2>Overview</h2>
												<blockquote>Sleeping is extremely important for people of every age. It plays an important role in human
													health and development, which can bring a huge advantage if we can maintain our sleep, as
													well as affect negatively to our daily life activities if we ignore or have sleep problems. We
													want to help people who have difficulty getting a good night’s sleep, and from that to
													improve their health. Therefore, our project will be related to the mobile app, sustained sleep,
													and health, which we called it GetWell. 
												<br><br>“More than 44% of workers in production-focused industries, such as factory workers and
												plant operators, report getting seven hours of sleep or less per night.” (Eric Suni, Dr.
												Kimberly Truong, Sleep Foundation, 2021). Some of the potential problems caused by sleep
												loss are high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attack, heart failure, or stroke. It is also affecting
												your physical health and mental health, including obesity, depression, anxiety, and
												psychosis. Realizing that issue, GetWell will help people erase the difficulty of sleeping and
												melt away the fatigue and stresses of everyone after a busy day. 
												<br><br>The idea was based on a relaxing mobile app that Viet Long and Lam Anh is researching
												and developing. They all want to create a mobile app that can help people to improve their
												health, and can connect with a real-life professional doctor to give people some useful
												advice about medicine, so that people don’t need to travel a far distance to get to the
												hospital. After heard Long and Lam Anh’s wants and desire, and had evaluated and
												estimated the probability of the whole team to accomplish this idea, we could say that we are
												confident to achieve this project. We have looked through the basics of developing the
												mobile app that Long and Lam Anh gave to us, we realized that most of GetWell’s functions
												are easy to be done and run well. However, we are still beginners in this field made it hard to
												perfect this app and create a friendly user interface. Therefore, we will try our best to
												complete and make it qualified enough so that everyone can use it to make their lives
												comfortable.

												complete and make it qualified enough so that everyone can use it to make their lives
												comfortable.
												<br><br>GetWell will focus on helping people cure sleep problems, improve their physical and mental
												health, and connect people to get well together. If the project is successful and we can be able
												to make it, firstly, it will save a lot of time for people. For example, minor illnesses like a
												cold or cough, they won't have to waste time going to the hospital, getting an order number
												and queuing up before being examined. We want to create a new IT trends, is the online
												hospital, where people can control their health and can have doctor’s advice as quick as
												possible. Therefore, can create a healthcare society and has its own platform similar to
												Facebook. Secondly, everyone can overcome their issues. The percentages of people who
												have sleep loss will reduce rapidly; everyone will be positive in the morning to work and live
												full of energy.
												<br><br>GetWell required many skills and qualifications to make it and release it to the public. We
												need to study front-end and back-end languages, such as Python, JavaScript, Java, maybe
												Swift (for IOS), and we need to understand the basic information when developing a
												mobile app. Besides coding, knowledge about biology is necessary, especially about the
												human respiratory system, to deal with sleep loss problems and touch the user’s demands.
												In short, we need to give our best shot at studying to have enough skills and knowledge to
												make GetWell come true. As we mentioned before, sleeping loss comes in many ways, so
												there will probably be times when GetWell won't work and cannot make users fall asleep.
												Moreover, nowadays, there are a lot of sleeping apps that appear and are famous in the
												world, for example: Relax Melodies, Sleep Cycle, or Recolour, leading to we will have a
												lot of “big” competitors. Not to mention, we are new in this field, so it will be challenging
												to promote and dispute customers and markets. However, GetWell is different from other
												sleeping app that it will connect to a real-life professional doctor so that every medicine and
												advice will be completely correct and suitable for each issue, and it has an AI that can
												communicate and give advice to users. And the chance is still there, as long as we can
												prove GetWell is different and more unique than other sleeping apps that can actually solve
												the sleeping loss or make users who have insomnia feel comfortable and improve their
												sleep.
