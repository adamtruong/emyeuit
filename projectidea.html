												<h2>Overview</h2>
												<blockquote>Sleeping is extremely important for people of every age. It plays an important role in human
													health and development, which can bring a huge advantage if we can maintain our sleep, as
													well as affect negatively to our daily life activities if we ignore or have sleep problems. We
													want to help people who have difficulty getting a good night’s sleep, and from that to
													improve their health. Therefore, our project will be related to the mobile app, sustained sleep,
													and health, which we called it GetWell. 
												<br><br>“More than 44% of workers in production-focused industries, such as factory workers and
												plant operators, report getting seven hours of sleep or less per night.” (Eric Suni, Dr.
												Kimberly Truong, Sleep Foundation, 2021). Some of the potential problems caused by sleep
												loss are high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attack, heart failure, or stroke. It is also affecting
												your physical health and mental health, including obesity, depression, anxiety, and
												psychosis. Realizing that issue, GetWell will help people erase the difficulty of sleeping and
												melt away the fatigue and stresses of everyone after a busy day. 
												<br><br>The idea was based on a relaxing mobile app that Viet Long and Lam Anh is researching
												and developing. They all want to create a mobile app that can help people to improve their
												health, and can connect with a real-life professional doctor to give people some useful
												advice about medicine, so that people don’t need to travel a far distance to get to the
												hospital. After heard Long and Lam Anh’s wants and desire, and had evaluated and
												estimated the probability of the whole team to accomplish this idea, we could say that we are
												confident to achieve this project. We have looked through the basics of developing the
												mobile app that Long and Lam Anh gave to us, we realized that most of GetWell’s functions
												are easy to be done and run well. However, we are still beginners in this field made it hard to
												perfect this app and create a friendly user interface. Therefore, we will try our best to
												complete and make it qualified enough so that everyone can use it to make their lives
												comfortable.

												perfect this app and create a friendly user interface. Therefore, we will try our best to
												complete and make it qualified enough so that everyone can use it to make their lives
												comfortable.
												<br><br>GetWell will focus on helping people cure sleep problems, improve their physical and mental
												health, and connect people to get well together. If the project is successful and we can be able
												to make it, firstly, it will save a lot of time for people. For example, minor illnesses like a
												cold or cough, they won't have to waste time going to the hospital, getting an order number
												and queuing up before being examined. We want to create a new IT trends, is the online
												hospital, where people can control their health and can have doctor’s advice as quick as
												possible. Therefore, can create a healthcare society and has its own platform similar to
												Facebook. Secondly, everyone can overcome their issues. The percentages of people who
												have sleep loss will reduce rapidly; everyone will be positive in the morning to work and live
												full of energy.
												<br><br>GetWell required many skills and qualifications to make it and release it to the public. We
												need to study front-end and back-end languages, such as Python, JavaScript, Java, maybe
												Swift (for IOS), and we need to understand the basic information when developing a
												mobile app. Besides coding, knowledge about biology is necessary, especially about the
												human respiratory system, to deal with sleep loss problems and touch the user’s demands.
												In short, we need to give our best shot at studying to have enough skills and knowledge to
												make GetWell come true. As we mentioned before, sleeping loss comes in many ways, so
												there will probably be times when GetWell won't work and cannot make users fall asleep.
												Moreover, nowadays, there are a lot of sleeping apps that appear and are famous in the
												world, for example: Relax Melodies, Sleep Cycle, or Recolour, leading to we will have a
												lot of “big” competitors. Not to mention, we are new in this field, so it will be challenging
												to promote and dispute customers and markets. However, GetWell is different from other
												sleeping app that it will connect to a real-life professional doctor so that every medicine and
												advice will be completely correct and suitable for each issue, and it has an AI that can
												communicate and give advice to users. And the chance is still there, as long as we can
												prove GetWell is different and more unique than other sleeping apps that can actually solve
												the sleeping loss or make users who have insomnia feel comfortable and improve their
												sleep.
											</blockquote>
											<h2>Aims</h2>
											<blockquote>
												After a lengthy discussion with many ideas and comments that we have given out to each of
												our project ideas, we decided to choose GetWell - a health mobile app that Viet Long and
												Lam Anh is researching and developing to be our project idea for the assignment. We have
												considered the realistic of the project GetWell and realized that it is not too difficult to
												complete and it is suitable for us who are learning about technology and the internet of things.
												GetWell is a free-to-use, mobile app that helps people control their sleep and makes sleeping
												much more accessible by using specific sound or user favorite music. &quot;Sleep is an essential
												function that allows your body and mind to recharge, leaving you refreshed and alert when
												you wake up&quot; (Alexa Fry, Dr. Abhinav Singh, Sleep Foundation, 2020). Good sleep is like
												when we do regular exercise or eat a healthy balanced diet; the more you do, the more
												benefits you gain. However, &quot;More than 44% of workers in production-focused industries,
												such as factory workers and plant operators, report getting seven hours of sleep or less per
												night.&quot; (Eric Suni, Dr. Kimberly Truong, Sleep Foundation, 2021). Sleep deprivation usually
												comes from the effect of the environment around you or comes from your bad habits, such as
												uncomfortable bed, overeating at night, not having a reasonable sleep timetable, drinking too
												much medicine, or absorbing over-limited caffeine. For that the app has extension feature
												which is your personal AI doctor, so every time you feel illness you can tell the app your
												symptoms and the app can give advice on what drug to use, or you can search the information
												for the drug you do not know by asking the AI so you can have a better health when taking
												the right drug. After, the app has enough user we can start selling ad of bed, mattress, clinic,
												medicine for profit to maintain the app. All of that is to serve the aim of the app, which is to
												make society a better place to be by improving the health of the user by reminding the user to
												wear warm clothes when the weather is cold or drink enough water for the day.
												<br><br>The goal of this app is to make an app for Vietnamese-speaking people that can be used by
												everyone in the world. An app is simple enough yet still has all the functions that users do not
												know they need. Because now, we do have many apps for sleep, but all of them are too
												complicated. which is sometimes hard to use for old people or people who do not know
												English. So, we want the app to be used in many languages, like Vietnamese, so old people in
												Vietnam or people with little chance of learning English can use the app. To do that, the app
												will use more pictures than words to guide the user because seeing is better than reading. By
												including more images in the app, it can be made easier to use for a baby. 
												The app will improve the user&#39;s health not only by improving sleep quality, but also by
												eliminating the incorrect use of medicine.Because there are many people out there when they
												are sick, they sometimes do not know which medicine to take or take the wrong medicine,
												which can lead to the disease becoming more serious than ever. The AI for the app can take
												input from the user&#39;s symptoms and combine them with the data it has learnt. The AI can then
												give advice to the user on which drug to use to feel better. That helps decrease the chance of
												side effects the drug can bring if used incorrectly. Also, it can help users find information
												related to the medicine they have inside their houses so they know which drug is which and
												how to use it properly.
												<br><br>Even though the app has two goals but the primally goal for the app is to make the app by
												Vietnamese that easy to use for every person no matter they are Vietnamese or not. So, on the
												development phase the team will focus more on the UI/UX, so the app is easy to understand
												no matter which language the user chooses. After that goal achieved, we will move to the Ai
												doctor. So even if the team have a short window of time to work on this project, we will do
												the best to make sure the app UI/UX is easy for everybody to use and run smoothly as
												possible.
											</blockquote>
											<h2>Plans and Progress</h2>
											<blockquote>
												Let&#39;s talk about what our project will do. Because this is a health app, the first time it is
												activated by the user, will collect all the basic information about the user, like name, age,
												language, and region. But beyond all the basic information, the app will also require the user
												to give out some basic information about their health status: height, weight, allergy to food,
												or any type of medicine. At the end of the activation process, the app will ask the user for
												their habits and what they like the app to look like and sound like. After that, all the users will
												do is just turn the app on and enjoy the relaxing sound that the user chooses the app to play.
												The user can also connect to other music apps like Spotify, Apple Music, and Soundcloud to
												play music through the app while sleeping or resting. After a while, the AI can learn from the
												user&#39;s habits and give suggestions for the next time they use the app. Also, by learning the
												user&#39;s daily routine, the app can know when the user has a problem and ask if the problem is
												related to their health and suggest the user take proper medicine. or just there for the user to
												ask if this medicine is safe or proper to use.
												<br><br>Well, to make this project do what I want to do, the first thing to do is create the AI, which
												will help the app learn from user habits and learn the basics of medical knowledge for
												diagnostics on what to do when the user is ill. And, to give advice on medicine when a user
												asks for it. After the AI has learned everything, we will need a doctor to test the data and the
												outcome of the AI, so we can know for sure if the AI is safe enough to use in real-life. If
												everything goes well, the AI will now be interested in the app. Besides a team focused on AI,
												the other team will focus on making the app for IOS and Android. They will create the app
												with all the basic functions that can work without the AI, like playing sound and connecting
												to 3 rd party apps to play music. And that team will also have the responsibility of making the
												UI beautiful and simple. When both teams&#39; work is completed, it will be combined with the
												app and tested on a small scale with about 100 beta users to find any bugs in the app and to
												see if the AI can process all of the requests sent back to the server.When 100 beta user tests
												are completed and fixed all the bugs, it is time to test the app on a larger scale with 10,000
												beta users with the same goal as the previous test. And then the app will be released for
												everyone in the world to download and use. But, for the time being, no one on our team
												knows how to create an AI capable of the aforementioned tasks.And we do not have the
												knowledge for the IOS and Android apps, so the app now is going nowhere. But we knew
												which road to take in order to make the project come true. For the time being, we have
												completed the design for the UI of the app and started collecting data about medical
												conditions. So, by the time we learn how to build AI and iOS and Android apps, we can start
												the project as fast as we can. Besides the knowledge for the app, our team also reached out to
												people, including our friends and family, to ask them to join the beta test, and we now have
												more than 100 people who have agreed to join, so for the testing phase, we have nothing to
												worry about. For the doctor to test the AI, we reached out to a member of the Lam Anh
												family, and she agreed to help us once the project is finished. Every brick is in place. All that
												is needed is to wait until we finish the app and the AI.
												<br><br>Now let&#39;s talk about how we started this project in the first place. Long is the person who got
												the ideal of GetWell in the first place. Back in the day, when he was doing assignment 1 of
												Intro to IT, Long got stuck here and was on the way to picking the right idea for the
												assignment. But after a while, he notices the people around him, seeing them having trouble
												falling asleep, and he gets inspired by the app called Relax Melodies. So, from that point, he
												considers all the aspects of this project, like its realistic, difficulty, and profit, and sees that
												this project is a very good thing to start on the way to becoming a professional programmer.
												And then, after the first assignment of that subject, we moved to assignments 2 and 3. At that
												point, we needed to choose a project for the final report. So, after discussion, Lam Anh and
												Long agreed to combine both of their ideas into one project. For Lam Anh, his idea is to
												create an app using AI to determine what illness the user is having and then give advice on
												what type of medicine dose the user should take or search for information on a certain
												medicine the user is taking but does not know how to use it. He stated that he has seen the
												consequences of using the wrong drug for a long time, and that it can make the patient worse
												than before.And he is tired of people in the family always asking him what this drug is used
												for. So, because of that, he wanted to make an AI to put in an app to solve this problem, and
												by luck, he found the Long Project, which is also a health app. While Lam Anh was still
												thinking about what type of app he could put the AI in, he decided to join the Long Project
												and make the AI as an extension feature to GetWell. It would make the app more unique than
												any other app out there. But don&#39;t stop there; both of them are Vietnamese, and after further
												discussion, the group concluded that why stop at a sleep aid and an AI doctor when there is
												no app specifically designed for Vietnamese people to use?So, the team wants to make
												something that is easy to use for almost any Vietnamese person, as well as people from other
												countries.
												<br><br>So, in order to put the plan into motion, we have to consider what we can do now, what we
												need to learn, and how many stages there are. For that, we decide on 3 stages: fine tuning the
												project, development, and testing. At this moment, we are still in the first stage, but we have
												completed the basic design for the UI and UX. Besides that, we have reduced some of the
												features that are no longer needed for the app. The reason we are still at stage one is that no
												member at the time could create the app for iOS and Android as well as create the AI needed
												for the app. So, by the time we are learning new knowledge for this project to start stage two,
												we are collecting the data for the AI to learn when we complete building it.
												<br><br>In stage one of this project, we have come to a dead-end many times. The first one is the
												design of the UI. We have to try many combinations of colors and button shapes. And trust
												us, the first few designs are terrible, just because we are in need of something fun to laugh at.
												But after a few days, we started to agree on the color template and the basic look. Following
												that, it is difficult to find wallpaper suitable for the app for the first few mock-ups of this
												app.And then comes another hard thing to deal with: should we use buttons with letters or
												pictures more? That led to more than 2 meetings just to come to the conclusion of a simple
												menu that had buttons with pictures. because the picture will be simpler to understand than
												the word. Now that we have completed the basic design, it is time to move on to the features
												of this project. Long decides to play smooth sounds in the background or combine with a 3rd
												party app to play music and turn your phone or tablet into an electronic watch that you can
												customize in any way you see fit for sleep assistance.And then the extension feature of Lam
												Anh, which is the AI doctor, which he calls GRACE. At first, it will not only be able to give
												advice on what medicine to take when tired or ill or search for information about medicine,
												but the AI will also give advice on how to get to a nearby hospital if the user needs to make
												an appointment with a doctor, etc. But there are too many features and some of them are not
												suitable for someone who just wants to relax, so we decided to keep the medicine advice and
												search for information about medicine.
											</blockquote>
											<h2>Roles</h2>
											<blockquote>
												We decided to assign these roles based on each member&#39;s contributions to the project as well
												as their areas of interest.First, the lead developers for the app will be Long and Duy, because
												GetWell is the project of Long himself, and for Duy, he has vast experience in programming
												and good knowledge. Then we moved on to the lead developer for the AI – GRACE will be
												in charge of Lam Anh because this is what he wants to do and, based on the career path he
												chooses, having a real-life project on AI will be helpful for him. And even more, from this, he
												can use GRACE for future projects more by upgrading the programming for GRACE and
												updating new databases. And during the time we make the mock-up for the project, no one in
												our team can design better than Adam, so there is no question about putting him in charge of
												the User Interface Design. And the roles of Adam and Duy can be changed if the UI is ready
												but the app is still in need of development as well as AI. Then Duy will move to AI with Lam
												Anh to help him and Adam will go to app development to help Long with the coding.
												
											</blockquote>
											<h2>Scope and Limits</h2>
											<blockquote>
												For this project, the scope of our team is to create an app that is suitable for people who suffer
												from the difficulty of falling asleep or having trouble with their health. So, to solve that
												problem, people are suffering, and with the time and knowledge we have, we will create the
												first version of the app with the ability to play relaxing sounds and music for the user to relax
												and fall asleep easily. The music can be played by being connected to a 3 rd  party app like
												Spotify. And for the above-mentioned extension feature, to take care of the user&#39;s health, at
												this point, we want to make the AI – GRACE make medical decisions like what illness the
												user has and what drug should they take, as well as reminding them to keep their health at its
												best by wearing proper clothing.But for now, with the limit, we can only make the app search
												for the drug and give simple advice on clothing by checking the weather in the place the user
												lives. Talking about GRACE, in the first place, the team wants to make a virtual character
												like the ISEKAI project from Bookwalker, which uses an anime character for the AI to
												communicate with the user. But now for the time being, we will replace that with a much
												simpler way. GRACE will now have a button with a picture or a symbol depending on the
												user&#39;s choice, and then the user can input data using a keyboard or speak with GRACE about
												the medicine they want to ask for or ask GRACE to play a sound. The user will want to relax,
												and GRACE will speak back to confirm and do what the user requests.
											</blockquote>
											<h2>Tools and Technology</h2>
											<blockquote>For the first step of the project, we will need a server with 16GB of RAM, 2TB of HDD for
												storage, one Intel Xeon or I7 series 8 model H to process the input data, and two GPUs from
												Nvidia for the AI to process the data and be able to accept upgrades later. Moving to the
												software, start with Long first. Java may be the best language option for this project because
												it is the most used language and it is also the most supported language by Google. We will
												use it from Vscode to coding and use Canvas to make the interface and then code it into Java.
												We need to study front-end and back-end languages, such as Python, JavaScript, Java,
												MySQL, AWS, NodeJS, Laravel, and ExpressJS, to help us build the database for the app to
												process and store the necessary data as well as create the logic for the app and GRACE. The
												app interface will be written for both iOS and Android, so Swift and Kotlin are important for
												the app to run on the OS (operating system). To compile the code, we will use Visual Studio
												Code because it is free and a very powerful tool for any developer. For the GRACE part, we
												will use AutoML, which is one of the strongest and most fairly developed tools and libraries
												for developing AI, and PyCharm to code Python files related to GRACE. For our team
												experience with these tools and technologies, Lam Anh has experience working with servers
												back in the day. He used to go with his father to the server room in his company to play and
												see people working there as well as learn from their work. Duy has 5 years’ experience in
												coding with Python and C++, so there won’t be any problem for him helping on the AI and
												app because with C++ experience, he can learn Swift in no time. For Long and Adam, both of
												them have experience in Python now, and they can use Canvas to create beautiful mock-ups
												and basic designs for the app. Besides that, the whole team has experience working with
												HTML and CSS back in assignment 2, so in any case the app needs to build a website, we
												can do it easily. Beyond that, unfortunately, our team still lacks experience with iOS and
												Android apps as well as AI projects.</blockquote>
											<h2>Testing</h2>
											<blockquote>
												Any product released to the market must go through the testing phase to remove all
												imperfections. Our project will also go through a test before we release it. Together, all of the
												beta users are friends and family of each team member in the group, and their friends of
												friends. Combined with my family members all over Vietnam, with more than 10,000
												members, we will have more than enough to make this test. For this phase, we will have two
												times of testing. The first test will be using 100 beta users. At this test, we will give them a
												link to download the app to their phone and let them create their own account. The group will
												have 2 weeks to use the app and send feedback back to us. The condition is that they must use
												it before they sleep and ask GRACE for advice or information at least 10 times in a week. All
												of the data pertaining to this state will be stored and analyzed. All medical advice will be sent
												to my family member who is a doctor and will decide if GRACE has accurate at least 90% of
												the time and 75% of the testers feel their sleep quality increased after using the app, then we
												will call it passed. Also, at the time of the test, we will fix all the bugs that the tester found.
												After two weeks, we will begin testing number two, in which we will increase the number of
												beta users to 1000; this time, the goal will be to see if the number of users increases that
												much in a day, and if the system can keep up with it; otherwise, too many errors may occur.
											</blockquote>
											<h2>Timeframe</h2>
											<blockquote>
												So, in total, we will have 16 weeks to work on, so the first four weeks are the planning up
												weeks, in which we work on our ideals for the assignment. We decided on a project: what is
												the purpose of this project, what features will it have, how will it look, and what materials
												will we need to build it. After that 4-week period passes, we will have only 12 weeks to
												complete the project. The project will be developed over the course of eight weeks, with the
												first two weeks devoted to learning the fundamentals of each tool required by the project as
												well as the coding language. week 7, we will complete the final  sketch design for the UI so
												we can start coding in week 8. During weeks 8–12, we will divine the group to do each
												member a task, with Long and Duy developing the app with all of the features that won’t
												need GRACE to operate and preparing the features that need GRACE to standby for the end
												of week 11. For Adam, he will be dealing with the UI and UX. For Lam Anh, he will be in
												charge of developing GRACE, so at the end of week 11, GRACE will be ready to combine
												with the app to run all the features. Week 12 will be demo week. We will try the app
												ourselves and check to see if any bugs are still exiting as well as introduce it to the testers.
												Then the last 4 weeks will be divided into 2 weeks of testing for each test. During this time,
												we want to see the feedback from beta users and locate as many bugs as possible to address
												them and make sure the final product is as perfect as possible.

											  <h2>Risks</h2>
											  <blockquote>
												There are numerous risks associated with any project, including the risk of health or computer
												failure, as well as risks posed by the tools and technology, as well as the human factor. The
												first risk that the project has is the chance of the music player inside the app having trouble
												connecting to a 3 rd  party music app and can get errors here and there at any moment. The next
												risk comes from our being new to the IT industry. Our knowledge and experience won’t be
												able to learn and master all the technology at its best, so some functions like voice
												recognition or AI won’t be able to work at their best state compared to all the people who
												have gone before us. So, there is a chance that when finished, the AI might misunderstand
												what the user wants. When building GRACE, the hardest thing is to find the right library for
												GRACE to learn about medical topics. However, most of the libraries for AI development
												may or may not have enough knowledge, so we can face the chance to collect the data on our
												own, which leads to the risk that the project may not be able to be finished in time based on
												the timeframe. And the biggest risk to the project is that if the requests are sent back to the
												server too much and GRACE processes them incorrectly, then GetWell can print out wrong
												advice or drug information for the user, and that can lead to lethal issues for the user&#39;s health.
												And that risk comes right from the reason that we do not have much experience in the AI
												field and mobile apps at the moment. The least important risk is that, due to a lack of
												experience in mobile app development, the product of our team may have issues like lagging
												or stopping working suddenly on the user device. Moving to the hardware of this project, the
												server for GRACE and GetWell to operate and store all necessary data. The risk of this does
												not just come from the hardware breaking down suddenly, but also the chance of the
												equipment overheating if the server must process too many requests. That can cause the issue
												mentioned above, or the system shutting down automatically to prevent further damage, or
												any data the team owns being corrupted by viruses, which causes the user to feel dissatisfied.

											  <h2>Group processes and Communication</h2>
											  <blockquote>
												There is no doubt that communication between group members is vital for any project&#39;s
												success. Why? Because without communication, a group is just a bunch of people working as
												individuals, not working together as a whole. So, that can lead to people doing the same task
												twice or people feeling like their voice has not been heard by anyone, which makes the group
												fall apart. But when the group works as a whole, it’s a different story. The team can solve the
												problem that one person won’t be able to do by thinking of what only the power of many
												minds can think of. With a team, people can share their work to do fewer jobs than before,
												and complete them faster than one person, saving time and money for the project.
												<br><br>
												So, for our team, we always tried to keep the communication flowing between the members.
												We always meet at school at least twice a week, but aside from that, we use different methods
												to communicate with each other from 1 to 2 times a week, mainly online, because our houses
												are not near each other that much. When possible, we will have an offline meeting at school,
												but when it is not, we will use Messenger and Discord to work with each other. Messenger
												will be used for us to send your ideals and solutions, as well as links and photos related to the
												project. For Discord, it will be used for the purpose of online meetings or when we want to
												show the work of each member but can still setup an offline meeting. We chose Discord over
												Teams or Zoom due to Discord&#39;s better streaming quality. But the most important thing is still
												what to do when a group member does not communicate. What will we do in that case? We
												already have basic contact information such as a phone number and an email address.So, we
												will contact him/her privately on Messenger first. If he/she doesn’t respond, we will call their
												phone number to talk directly to that member and ask them to communicate more with the
												group, as well as ask if there is any problem that is causing communication difficulty, and
												then we will do our best to solve that problem.
