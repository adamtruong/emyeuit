									<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic020.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
									<blockquote>I was born in Hanoi, Vietnam, and the only child in my family. Up to this moment, I’m currently studying as a student of RMIT Vietnam – Hanoi campus. My major is IT (Information technology). I can use fluently English, Vietnamese: understand and read Chinese, Korean.  One of the facts about myself is that apart from my name being Hua Lam Anh, my friend also sometimes calls me by the name John. And sometimes I like to call myself Doctor, that name reminds me of my only rule I live by: Run fast, laugh hard, always try to be nice but never fail to be kind. As a hobby, I am really into cooking and taking photos of everything around me. My style is street photography, landscape, portrait. And recently I have discovered a new hobby – codding. Which apart from those 3, I do not have any hobby else. For me, personally, I really hate sport and bad food. I think sport is a waste of time. </blockquote>
									<blockquote>At first, my father was an IT employee in charge of his company server room. And during the time my father was in charge, he used to bring me to the server room to watch his work and see the computer there. Not all, he was also the one who taught me how to fix and build my very first computer. Combine with many movies about hackers, those things made me realize all the incredible things that IT could do. And the movie that I watch the most that makes me fall in love with IT is “CSI cyber”. Since there I teach myself html and CSS, for now I’m studying python. My first project with html and CSS is my personal landing page</blockquote>

										<h2>Tests Result</h2>
									</header>
									<p>For me, each test is a reference, so I can understand myself better. And doing so, it helped me to find out the most suitable way of learning that enabled me to learn everything at 110% of my capacity. Like the second test which shows me which type of learner I am, and through that I know I’m a visual learner. So, I can adapt the way I review my lesson to save time and improve efficiency. The other two tests can show me how I can be more useful in a teamwork environment. And who I can work with to maximize the productivity. But, like a penny, it has a downside, it can disable me the ability to think outside the box, to try new things, to try to work with different people instead of just one type of people. 
										I believed the result can influence my behavior in a team in a positive way. Why because before doing the test, I already consider myself someone extraverted. So, when in a teamwork environment, I can be more confident than ever to work with other teammates as myself, it boosts my confidence when looking for a teammate or making discussion within the team. The test shows me which creative type I am, so it can be a reference for me to know where to look for a new idea. Which eventually saved me time on my project or deadline. But there is more than that, it can bring me passive benefit because the result can become an advertisement for me, which helps people get to know me more, so they can decide to put their trust in me. 
										I should take this into account when forming a team, so I know where my strength is and where my weakness is. Knowing that, I know who to choose to make up for what I lack of and to provide me with more experience in increasing my strength as well as improving my weakness. And knowing that means I can put all irrelevant emotion out of the job and make a logical decision when choosing teammates, so they can work as best as possible. </p>
