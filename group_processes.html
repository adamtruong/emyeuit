												<blockquote>There is a new thing about assignment 3, in which we need to make a presentation
												introducing our project idea before writing a report. Just like we did in assignment 2, the first
												thing we do is to have a meeting in order to make a plan, make a decision and separate
												workloads. We decided that Long and Nhat Anh will be in charge of the presentation which
												is making the slides for the team, Lam Anh and Duy will do the document of assignment 3,
												and when we finish it, we will have another meeting to improve and fix the mistake of the
												assignment as well as practising for the presentation. With a reasonable division of time for
												each work, responsible for the jobs, working effectively and always prioritising getting the
												job done, we have finished the presentation and the document earlier than what we planned .
												Therefore we have more time to correct mistakes and practice for the presentation. We have
												been a team and work together since Assignment 2 until now, and I have to say that we had a
												wonderful time collaborating. Despite the fact that we have only been working together for a
												short time, the way we communicate, make decisions, and separate workloads is excellent
												and effective, as if we have known and worked with each other for a long time. The more we
												interact and work together, the more we understand and support each other. In the future, I
												think the school should create group exercises earlier so that students can find groups and
												have more time to get to know and understand more about each other.
