										<h2>About me</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I am a student of VAS Ha Noi for about 12 years and 
										completed it in 2020. I am very excited to study in 
										college, especially at RMIT because RMIT is a new 
										environment, new opportunity, and new difficulties 
										which make my sense of triumph arise in order to 
										conquer it. I can speak 3 languages in total, which are 
										English, Chinese and Vietnamese. I am an 18-year-old 
										boy who considers football as his passion but cannot 
										become the champion in any single tournament in the 
										past 3 years of high school. I am interested in football because it not only helps me to improve 
										my physical strength, but also it helps me to develop my social skills and teamwork skills, which 
										make it easier for me to make new friends with like-minded people. Although the love for football 
										is enormous, I usually spend my free time comforting myself at home, enjoying the moment 
										when there is just only me in my room, chilling with some lo-fi music, and ignoring all the social 
										pressures that thrust upon me. From that, you can call me a homebody.</p>

										<h2>Tests Result</h2>
									</header>
									<p>From my point of view, this is just a general test that only right in some ideas or opinions, which 
										it’s just a resource for people to refer it and improve themselves. However, I must say that I agree 
										with the point that I’m an introvert that needs to prepare carefully before doing something. And 
										I’m more inclined to be emotional and creative in work than logical so that I can create motivation 
										for my team members which can help them to concentrate on their work and finish it with their 
										best. And I might help my team to avoid as many problems as possible before starting projects 
										or events as well as helping them to tackle difficulties. I realized that sometimes, I overload 
										myself, and this can lead to a lack of healthy emotional expression that can lead to a lot of stress 
										and frustration, which is the same as the test mentioned. Therefore, I cannot do a lot of work at 
										the same time with a short deadline. I can use these online tests to introduce myself and let them 
										have more information as well as understand my personality so that we can work and support 
										each other in our project and improve skills and abilities together</p>
