										<h2>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING</h2>
									</header>
									<div class = "box">
											<p>
												Before discussing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), let’s talk about how they work. Artificial intelligence systems do not need to be pre-programmed; instead, they employ algorithms that function with their intelligence. It employs machine learning methods such as Reinforcement learning and deep learning neural networks. AI is being employed in various applications, including Siri, Google's AlphaGo, and AI in chess playing. Machine learning is a branch in the field of AI; it allows a computer system to forecast or make judgments based on past data without being explicitly programmed. In order for a machine learning model to deliver trustworthy findings or make predictions based on that data, it takes considerable use of structured and semi-structured data. Throughout the history of AI development, it has opened the door to many new technologies. For example, the algorithm to make the machine can do a task or learn to do something new in a shorter time than humans. If not for the algorithm, we will never be able to create all of the AI we are currently using by enabling ML. Algorithms improved the performance of ML when learning from data input. Prediction, clustering, classification, and dimensionality reduction are the four most significant types of issues that must be tackled using machine learning. Machine learning may be classified into four groups based on the classification of learning methods: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. But for an Ai to be easy to use, the developer has developed Natural Language Processing (NPL) which refers to a computer’s capacity to detect and interpret human written language, which is a cross-disciplinary issue including computer science and human linguistics. The most significant distinction in natural language is that human thought is founded on language, hence natural language processing is likewise a goal of AI. Natural language processing is separated into seven categories: grammatical and semantic analysis, information extraction, text mining, information retrieval, machine translation, question answering, and conversation systems. So, the user can communicate with the AI easier like talking to a person. Due to the power it needs to process AI’s neural network, it has boosted the GPU technology to a whole new level. Providers like NVIDIA have to improve their technology including both the hardware and the software to optimise the power of the GPU every year to keep up with the demand. And thanks to all of the state of art in AI and ML, the application of AI is unlimited in our daily life. AI can help you read faster like “SummarziedBot”. Artificial intelligence and machine learning can automatically text summarisation, analyse the conversation, and deliver useful information. “SummarizeBot”, a natural language processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and blockchain-powered bot, is now available on Facebook Messenger and Slack. AI can be trained to detect certain sounds, which will come in handy for people with hearing problems. AI can give users a notification of which sound is around them like gunshots or sirens from police cars, ambulances and many more. More advanced AI’s technology can open a brand-new door to how virtual assistants (VA) work, like Google Duplex which made VA speak like a real human so now you can make an appointment with any person or place just by giving the detail to your VA and then VA can call to the person or place you want. And so many more things that AI is capable to do at this moment. And for the part of ML, with ML companies and organisations can input big data to the system to process. And the outcome of that process can be the improvement of sell-by having the better insight of the customers ``Coca-Cola's global market and extensive product list—more than 500 drink brands sold in more than 200 countries—make it the largest beverage company in the world. Not only does the company create a lot of data, it has embraced new technology and puts that data into practice to support new product development, capitalize on artificial intelligence bots and even trialing augmented reality in bottling plants.” (Forbes, by Bernard Marr). Or ML can be used to find a better way to use energy more efficiency; this can also be used for medical by give the doctor second opinion on the CT scans because every year a doctor have to read too much CT scans and sometime it can cause some error, with AI and ML the system can give a diagnostic based on the experience of the previous doctor and safe more life than before. The application of AI and ML is only limited by our imagination. There is a lot of speculation regarding the "singularity" event in artificial intelligence in the future, particularly in the year 2050. The Singularity is frequently defined as the point at which exponential technological advances transcend the threshold of "strong AI," and robots possess broad intelligence that exceeds human levels. It is very likely that it will happen by 2050. Singularity also refers to the point at which human cognition and artificial intelligence converge. Human intelligence will be substantially interwoven with AI, resulting in a symbiotic relationship in which AIs will be improved by human creative and lateral thinking abilities. Simultaneously, AI's memory and speed of computation may benefit humans. To create artificial general intelligence (AGI), we need to solve all of the problems that are challenging AGI. The absence of a functional protocol to aid with artificial intelligence or machine learning networking is a concern. This flaw forces systems to operate as independent models in a confined area. And such a way of functioning is diametrically opposed to the complicated and highly social "human experience." Communication constraints obstruct smooth data exchange and machine learning model inter-learning, reducing universality. The lack of an artificial intelligence network also impedes the overall development of a shared purpose. Organisational leaders are unsure how to integrate AI into their company processes in order to achieve certain goals. The lack of direction and the fact that businesses cannot afford to recruit a specialised staff of AI professionals make implementing AI platforms expensive. And also, the true nature of how our human’s brain truly works. So, I hope that in the future, scientists have solved that problem so we can complete the electronic brain for AI to run on it, and developers can create more advanced algorithms for AI to be able to learn, to understand vast data out there and then connect all the data together. 
 
<br><br>For the development above, in person, I think it can have a significant impact on every single industry at this moment. The application of the artificial electronic brain is impressive in many ways. With it, we are one step closer to immortality, never going to face the sadness of losing people, you deer. Because now we can store their consciousness in the form of digital. And that brain opens a new way to make quantum computer cause the human brain is as strong as a quantum computer, just think about all of the tasks that the human’s brain processes in a second, quantum computer will be more efference when running because it won’t produce as much heat as right now just to calculate all of the possibilities. And that enables us to solve a hard problem in a shorter time than what a normal computer would do. Apart from that, a new and more robust algorithm can help businesses, factories, and many organisations work faster and more accurately because the system can process data more efficiently with a new algorithm. And saving time means saving money. The final impact is if AGI can be created, it will be able to replace human labour at some departments because, after all, AGI's purpose is to be able to handle the task on a human level. To me, the labour market and the way we used to work will be changed dramatically if technology has been achieved. Because at that time, AI could handle from simple to complex tasks equal to a human or even equal to a whole team of human employees. AGI can help scientists push up the speed of robotic development to create a new body for the AI to stay in and do all physical tasks. So, all dangerous jobs like a policeman, military, and firefighter now only need humans to command. Every hospital will never be short of staff because a robot equipped with AGI can quickly learn and practice like a typical nurse or doctor. But due to that change, it can affect many people who don’t have high education or a steady job because now AI can replace them to do the same position with better performance and less cost. That can lead to protests by the poor people, they need a job, but now there is no more job for them, after that it can lead to the starvation of many people because they have no money to buy food. But that outcome can be a bright side of society. Why? Because it will motivate the people to learn to develop themselves more, not just wait for someone to take care of them. And as AI gets more advanced, jobs like engineering in IT, AI, ML, and robotics will get hotter every year because we need more people to make new developments in all of those fields and keep AI-run as the best state. 
 
<br><br>There is no doubt that when AGI is achieved, the change in my daily life will be enormous. First, at that time, if I completed my plan and succeeded in my start-up company, AGI would be a crucial part of my life. Because now, with AGI, I can easily sit down and monitor the AI when it deploys and distributes the job to other employees. That simple task means that I will not need to hire a secretary. It will save my money and increase my company’s security because you can’t buy a machine to turn it back on the owner. With that in mind, it enables me to have more time in a typical 24-hour day just to think about new ideas, innovations, and profitable projects. Another benefit is that AI can help me on each project by calculating the percent chance that the project will succeed or fail by gathering all of the data available in the market. It saves time and money. The most significant impact is that AGI is the key to truly improving and achieving my life goal, which is to create an app that helps people and society have better health and a longer life span so that we can use the time we have to make the world a better place every day. And yes, AGI will make some differences in my life, like when we need to build a house or building, AI can calculate to make that process much faster while being cheap and reliable, so I will never have to see people with no home to go to. Agriculture can now have higher quality harvesting, increasing the plant's chances of survival in harsh environments and ensuring that no one goes hungry again. So, I will never have to see children in small and emerging countries die from having no food. And last, AGI will bring me the benefit of having better health care by predicting the problem with my body as soon as possible. That benefit will not only benefit me, but it will also benefit my friends and family members. AI can even give us the chance to have free time to connect with each other, or make new friends and create new connections. All of that will make my family stronger, happier, and closer than ever.

									<h2>BLOCKCHAIN AND CRYPTOCURRENCIES</h2>
								</header>
								<div class = "box">
										<p>
											Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are currently the two terms people seek the most in 2021. Let's discover more about these technologies and their functions. Usually, most people confuse Blockchain and cryptocurrencies, thinking that these two are the same. Although the two are different initiatives, both are closely linked. It is worth noticing that the uses of Blockchain can expand to other areas beyond its features that brings cryptocurrencies to life. 
<br>
<br>A cryptocurrency act like real currency, this type of currency can be traded online and converted to other currencies. Many companies have released their kind of cryptocurrency, which can explicitly trade for the good or service that the company provides. The rise of cryptocurrencies is based on the independence of the currency as no organization or government can control certain currencies like Bitcoin, Etherium and more because these currencies run independently. Moreover, the demands of the community value the price of these currencies, so over time, cryptocurrencies prevent inflation and increase their value for investors. And decentralized processing and recording system with every transaction through cryptocurrencies can be more secure than traditional payment systems. The operation behind cryptocurrencies to work and maintain security is Blockchain, which is the foundation of this technology.
<br>
<br>A blockchain is a distributed database shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital form. Furthermore, Blockchain is designed to record all transactions on a P2P network. Blockchain acts as an anonymous ledger. Although the details of transactions are kept secret, the catalogue is public. So people can view it to confirm that a transaction has taken place or not. Blockchain technology helps to reduce costs, increase transparency and bring efficiency. Satoshi Nakamoto created the Blockchain to record transactions made with Bitcoin, thus becoming a public ledger of transactions. His breakthrough has made Bitcoin the first cryptocurrency to use Blockchain in recording all transactions without the intervention of a third party or central authority. Most of the time, the operation of cryptocurrencies is based on Blockchain. To mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Blockchain is necessary and adequate. The Blockchain contains a set of "blocks", where each block includes details about transaction data or transactions made with the cryptocurrency, and when stacking those blocks on each other, it will create a chain. Each block comprises puzzles that miners can solve to validate transactions. After successfully solving the problem, a new block is developed and published to other nodes. Miners are then rewarded for completing the process. The reason why cryptocurrencies are more secure than traditional payment is based on how Blockchain works. If someone tries to remove or replace a block from the bottom of the chain, that action will destroy the entire structure because each block in the chain has the same information from the previous block encoded in it. Replacing a block with other information (different cryptography) will not match the last block and disconnect all blocks that follow it. Therefore, the information in this chain will be considered untrue. That is why blockchain technology can be viewed as a breakthrough in security.
<br>
<br>Based on an article on Forkast, "Blockchain applications that will change the world in the next 5 years." Blockchain to develop and apply to daily life, especially businesses, in the next five years. "With the world recovering from the pandemic and continuous technological innovation creating more and more opportunities for people across the globe, blockchain technology is set to transform everyday societal and economic structure" <strong>[1]</strong>. Although the blockchain industry is still a new technology and is still improving itself, numerous applications have been archived. Blockchain will be one of the main factors that will change the world over the next half-decade. And for cryptocurrencies, after the unimaginable breakthrough in 2021, people have a bright vision of this type of currency. In the long term, cryptocurrencies could be a part or replace the trading currency. But for a short time after the trend, cryptocurrencies could be more stable than the present. 
<br>
<br>Blockchain is currently the leading trend technology applied in many industries and fields. Countries or large enterprises spend a lot of money and time investing and researching blockchain technology because of its strong applicability and unbreakable security.
<br>
<br>For instance, we need a ledger to monitor the production process, inventory, distribution, quality, transaction information, and more in manufacturing. Blockchain will be an intelligent technology that grants management efficiency to increase the productivity of supply chain management processes dramatically. For consumers, checking whether the product is genuine or not will prevent all fake and counterfeit products on the market.  
<br>Some applications of Blockchain in production:  
<li>Traceability of products produced through stages. </li>
<li>Monitor the supply of raw materials for industrial production.</li>
<li>Inventory management, production warehouse. </li>
<li>Monitor production schedule, quantity purchased and sold.</li>

<br>Furthermore, In the medical field, Blockchain is applied to improve data management. Blockchain will support doctors in asset management and storing patient health information, inventory management, orders, payments for medical devices and pharmaceuticals. Although there are many smart devices to monitor these services, there are many limitations on patients' information confidentiality. Therefore, Blockchain is a preferred option.
<br>Some applications of Blockchain in the field of Health:
<br>The advanced application includes disease monitoring and management (such as smart drugs, wearable devices that can measure health indicators and give feedback) and enhances quality management.
<br>Supply chain management of drugs and medical equipment: Track input, origin, and expiry date of medical supplies.
<br>Enhance transparency and automation in medical examination and treatment transactions, clinical tests, ownership of patient health data.
<br>These are just two out of dozens more industries in that Blockchain can help improve our lives. In the process of applying smart technology to life, as well as improving information processing and security processes. 
<br>And for the cryptocurrencies which are built on Blockchain can solve problems related to security and the transparency of transactions. Take donations activities, for example; many philanthropists today are frustrated by the widespread corruption in charities. If donations from these donors continue to decline, some people who need help may end up in dire straits. The good news is that Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies have the potential to reduce, or even prevent, the leakage of funds in charities. WFP is an example of a global organization using Blockchain technology to distribute money to the hungry around the world strategically.
<br>
<br>In my opinion, these technologies are still in their early stage, but a bright future is still ahead. Not only me but many have experienced how the whole market of cryptocurrencies work through trading coins. And investors are making profits from the rise of Blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, more and more applications are being brought to life as more people continue to understand and popularize digital currencies. It is also not difficult to convince that digital currency will be the norm in the future and that Blockchain will completely transform the way we conduct transactions and do business everywhere. Hopefully in the future blockchain applications will be more popular in Vietnam.

							<h2>ROBOTS</h2>
						</header>
						<div class = "box">
								<p>
									Robots have been no stranger to humans all over the years. These intelligent automation machines are exposed as our lives develop and upgrade over time. Nowadays, with the development of technology, robots have appeared in most countries globally, which can make human life more convenient, easier, and more efficient. 
<br>
<br>A robot is a machine controlled by the computer or the electronic circuit board, automatically performing complex actions without human involvement. The robot was made by humans' intelligence, creativity, and determination, characterised by virtual and artificial. Generally, there are five types of robots, which is:
<li>Pre-programmed robots (example: a mechanical arm on an automotive assembly line), </li>
<li>Humanoid robots (example: Hanson Robotics’ Sophia), </li>
<li>Autonomous robots (example: the Roomba vacuum cleaner),</li>
<li>Teleoperated robots (example: the PUMA 560),  </li>
<li>Augmenting robots (example: robotic prosthetic limbs). </li>
<br>Pre-programmed robots are machines that only do the tasks people tell them, and they cannot change their duty by themselves during the process. Humanoid robots resemble the human appearance, which performs human-like activities. Autonomous robots are auto robots or autobot that perform tasks without human control. Teleoperated robots, or telerobotics, are remotely controlled robots that operators can command from afar or safe distance. Augmenting robots are designed to supplement or replace a person's existing talents; they can be used in medical surgeries and military operations. 
<br>
<br>People have had to go through centuries to improve, develop, and upgrade robots to reach today's achievements. Like a famous quote say “Big things have small beginnings”, the word "robot" comes from the Czech term "robota", which means "forced labour", firstborn in the play RUR (Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti-Rossum's space robots) by the writer K. Čapek in 1922. However, until 1942, the term robotic became popular and more widespread in society thanks to the American author Isaac Asimov with his hugely successful stories about robots. Asimov envisioned a future in which robots obey Asimov's three laws of robotics – robots shall not harm people; robots shall obey people, and robots shall avoid activities that could hurt themselves. In 1954, the first programmable robot arm was designed by two American engineers George Devol and Joseph Engleberger, creating the world’s first industrial robot. And in the next two years, these two intelligence engineers had formed the world's first robot company: Unimation, Inc. In 1963, the first computer-controlled robotic arm was built to aid the disabled at Rancho Los Amigos Hospital in Downey, California. In 1973, the T3, (The Tomorrow Tool), the first commercially available minicomputer-controlled industrial robot, was released by Cincinnati Milacron Corporation. In 2000, the robotic industry achieved a lot of success, such as: 
<br><br>
<li>Honda successfully produced ASIMO Humanoid Robot, </li>
<li>Sony released the humanoid Sony Dream Robot, </li>
<li>The da Vinci Surgery System is the first robotic surgery system authorised by the Food and Drug Administration.</li>
<li>There are around 742 500 mechanical industries in the world. </li>
<br>The robotics industry got involved in Aerospace when in 2011, Robonaut 2- a human-like robot assistant was released by NASA and General Motors and launched on the space shuttle. The robot reached the next level when in October 2017, Sophia – an AI robot became the first robot to receive citizenship, which was Saudi Arabian citizenship, and became the first-ever non-human and first-ever Innovation Champion of the United Nations Development Programme right in the next month. 
<br>
<br>With the development of robots, people use them in various fields. Robots are used in education, restaurants, industry, hospitals, and even coffee shops. In La Duni, an American Latin restaurant in Texas, robots were hired to serve and greet customers. Coqueta, the hostess's aide, takes you to your table, the beverage runner, Alexcita, gives you your bottle of beer, and Panchita, the food runner, will bring all your appetisers to your table. These are the three robots' names from the company Robotech, in which Espartaco Borga, the owner of La Duni, rents the robots for $15 per day. In the medical field, The PARO Therapeutic Robot can improve the quality of life, emotion, mental health and relieve the stress of patients, especially the elderly, during their recovery from the surgery or treatment. Or the TUG robot was invented by Aethon Inc to deliver meals, drinks, supplies, medicines, and other materials around the hospital, which can help doctors and nurses reduce the heavy physical workloads and focus more on recovering patients and improving their health. The humanoid robot, for example, Sophia, is multi-talented about entertainment. She can sing, have a simple conversation, laugh and create art, which she can interact with people, express emotions through facial gestures., maintain eye contact and recognize people. According to David Hanson, the father of Sophia, Sophia is working on many musical pieces alongside human artists as part of Sophia Pop’s project. Moreover, on the 27th of November, 2020, at EDU 4.0 Education Technology Forum, Vietnam's first artificial intelligence robot was launched by the scientist, expert on AI (artificial intelligence) Pham Thanh Nam and his partner Pham Minh Toan. The robot called Tri Nhan, with a height of 1.8m can answer most fields' questions and has his own personality, creativity, and emotional intelligence. Tri Nhan will be served in education by effectively supporting the teaching and learning of teachers and students through answering, solving math problems and teaching assistants. Suppose AI technology and humanoid robots keep growing like that. In that case, I believe in the next three years, everywhere, every industry and field will always be AI robots, especially in the hospital. Imagine when people first step at the hospital, a receptionist robot will greet you, and an assistant robot will bring you to the doctor or room. Doctor robot will do surgery for you, and a nurse robot will take care of your health during the recovery section. And a small robot will bring you meals, water, suppliers and medicine on time. In short, that is the state of art of robots, they can do some tasks better, cheaper, and quicker than people. They can record and retain data, assist physicians and nurses in diagnosing patients, and even allow lower-level healthcare professionals to treat patients with less supervision from doctors and other higher-level personnel. 
<br>
<br>With the development of robots, they will replace humans soon, especially jobs related to heavy work and required quantity. According to Oxford University research, robots will do roughly half of all employment in the United States within the next 20 years. For example, in the agriculture industry, robots will replace humans, horses, buffalo, and some heavy farming equipment when seeding, watering, caring for plants, and harvesting. Soon, people won’t see any living things on the farm, which will only be robots instead. Many factories indeed started to replace people with machines, especially in the middle of Industrial Revolution 3.0 up to now, when the development of information technology, electronics, and production automation to the wireless network, automate complex tasks, and internet of things became widespread and massive to reduce cost on resources, social resources, and in means of production. The consequences of robots replacing humans would be creating an enormous loss of jobs and work. Leading people will not have a stable source of income and cannot improve their lives, which means they have to do anything to earn money, even illegal work. Therefore, the country's unemployment and crime rates will rapidly increase, creating an unstable economy and security.
<br>
<br>In my opinion, robots can be considered the kind friend of people. For example, I already have a lovely friend inside my smartphone, Siri. She will always lend a sympathetic ear whenever I have a problem, always answer my question without letting me wait, and always be there when I say “Hey, Siri”. Moreover, my family and I can share my household chores with my robots. The intelligent robot vacuum can help us to do sweeping, the dishwasher robot will wash all the dirty places and bowls, and the washing machine will make my family's clothes clean, fresh and smell wonderful. You can see that with robots, I can save a lot of time and use them to do other kinds of stuff, like chatting, hanging out with my friends and family, spending time with my family, doing homework, and taking care of my pets. With the help of household chores robots, my friends can have more time to play games and play football with me, which we can keep in touch and increase our brotherhood relationship. 
<br>
<br>In addition, robots are considered magical things that people can create with their own hands. It is state of the art, making human lives more accessible, creating convenient and improving daily life of people, but it is also a future challenge that humans need to deal with.

								<h3>I. Notable technologies of modern cybersecurity</h3>
								<br>Through decades, cybersecurity technology has continuously been evolving to protect the users’ privacy and safety and the cyber world in general. In this part, I will be discussing the characteristics and the impact, both present and future, of some of the most recent cybersecurity technologies.
								<br>Firstly, it is the Two-Factor Authentication. Ever since Deep Learning and Big Data was invented, the cybersecurity of the modern world has been utilising them almost all the time, mostly seen in well-known companies such as Meta, Google, or Amazon. From what I have seen how Two-Factor Authentication works, all users’ data will be stored in massive storage. When authorizing access to something, users will be prompted to input some parameters such as Date of Birth, recent comments, or a One-Time Passcode. After that, the parameters will be compared to that user’s true data in the storage. If all of them are correct, the user is free to access them [1]. Because of its simplicity and high security, numerous companies have been making use of it, notable examples are Facebook, Google, YouTube. Personally, Two-Factor Authentication will likely remain in use in the next 5 or 6 years. But on the dark side of cybersecurity, hackers have also been coming up with more dangerous attacks, which means that Two-Factor Authentication methods have to step up the game.
								<br>Speaking of Big Data, data mining has also been a valuable tool to track users and clients’ behaviours on the servers. To put it more specifically, it is called Behavioral Analytics. Behavioural Analytics can help cybersecurity officers trace potential security threats through abnormal data transmissions or transactions, therefore efficiently hunting down the threats. We have also seen many data mining applications on digital marketing and advertising, especially Facebook or Google. For example, Facebook will “mine” each user’s search requests or interactions and recommends ads/posts/groups related to those. Though its accuracy is still questionable sometimes, in my opinion, data mining will nonetheless be useful in other subjects such as medical treatment or online shopping apps in the near future, by using the same principles, e.g. recommending products based on user’s interactions, updating unusual health data from a patient,…
								<br>The 3rd technology that I happen to find ambitiously intriguing is the Intel vPro authentication chips. As far as I can tell, it has quite a few interesting traits that might replace all current means of authentication in the near future. Basically, the chip will be embedded in the device (mostly computers or servers), and after installing it, the user will have to install the Intel Authentication application on their smartphones. The application will tap into the phones’ Bluetooth signal to transmit and compare the user’s password on the attached device. If everything matches, the device will automatically grant access without having to type the password in[2]. This is extremely useful if you set a really cryptic password and forgot it, especially if you are a server admin when you have to deal with a lot of long passwords to avoid brute force attacks. Additionally, it can also counter keyloggers, since keyloggers only track keystrokes on the keyboard, which means that if the user does not type, they will be rendered useless. Not to mention, the Intel vPro chips also have multi-level authentication, which means that it can take multiple parameters to authorize, let it be fingerprints, face ID, passwords, PINs, etc. Speaking of PINs, the PIN layout of the Intel Authentication app can also swap every now and then, and only requires the user to tap on the screen[3]. These add up more layers of security to the system, and also furthermore disabling keyloggers. Even though these vPro chips have been released for more than 5 years, they are still only used in servers or mainframes. But in the future, with more updates, I am persuaded that these vPro chips will show their full capability when Intel releases them to all users around the world.
								<br>Through these examples, we can see that common technologies of the modern world have opened a large number of opportunities for the cyberworld. These upgrades may sound self-explanatory and sometimes might be underestimated as easy-to-come-up. But the core problem here is that it is nearly impossible to build because of hardware limitations, or to put it another way, if Big Data, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Bluetooth, Machine Learning,…did not exist, these cybersecurity technologies would not exist either.
								<br><br><h3>II. Their worldwide impacts</h3>
								<br>Regarding the Intel vPro chips and the Intel Authentication app, it is speculated that they will completely change the way users log in to their computers. To put it more specifically, they will replace any common means of authorization such as passwords. Additionally, these changes will mainly focus on server admins and employees in tech companies, as the vPro chips are aiming for modern enterprises or their mainframes for testing as far as I can tell. With Intel Authentication, employees and admins, again as I have said above, will log in to their devices by Bluetooth signals, instead of typing in passwords. Though it is still unknown that whether or not they will make an impact on most computer users. Nevertheless, vPro chips are guaranteed to provide a simpler and more secured authorization method to all users.
								<br>The Two-Factor Authentication technology has greatly impacted website authentication, especially on wide-area domains that monitor millions of users. It adds another dense layer of security, making it harder for hackers to sneak in or brute-forcing through. As most huge domains nowadays like Google, YouTube, or Facebook have been utilizing this technology, we can logically argue that most users around the world have been impacted by Two-Factor Authentication. In particular, when we sign in (for example, YouTube), a One-Time Passcode is usually sent to our phone or email account to verify that it is absolutely you signing in. This prevents account breaches, even if the hacker has the username and password since they have no way of accessing that OTP. However, since Two-Factor Authentication is still optional on most websites, some users often skip it, which then leads to their account being exposed to threats. That means, our most major challenge is to spread the importance of Two-Factor Authentication. Only when it is overcome, everyone will be safe.
								<br>Lastly, it is Behavioral Analytics. It is predicted that Behavioral Analytics will be a must for all entrepreneurs to market and advertise their products, services, or their companies themselves. Additionally, obsolete ways of advertising, even though they will not be replaced, will see a significant decrease, as most entrepreneurs will shift to digital marketing, rather than putting signs on the road, renting someone for advertising, etc. Behavioural Analytics will not replace nor make any redundancies. It will just add more simplicity, effectiveness, and efficiency to advertisements and services.
								<br><br><h3>III. Personal impacts</h3>
								<br>From my experiences, Two-Factor Authentication is undoubtedly a must-have for all of my accounts, whether it is Facebook, Google, Outlook, etc. Back then, I was just like every non-technophilea who does not care that much about security and skipped it, and the outcome is that I lost 2 Gmail accounts. But now, I have learned it the hard way, and after using Two-Factor Authentication for a few years, I feel like I am in total protection and security and have never lost any accounts since then. It might be tedious sometimes that I have to do some extra steps to gain access to my account, unlike before when I would just punch in the username and password. But now, I do not want to lose my data anymore, so I decided to proceed with it.
								<br>Regarding the vPro chips, I have to admit that I am a PC gamer myself, so I would prefer high-end CPUs like Intel core i7 or i9, and since both of them are not vPro chips, there might be even less chance for me to even try out one of those. I am looking forward to seeing Intel integrating the vPro to the Skylake family (since i7 and i9 are all in it), but it is going to be in the far future. Still, if I were to try one of them now with Intel Authentication, it might be a bit awkward at first, since I have to raise my phone instead of typing in the password to unlock the computer. But overall, I think it will not affect my computer experience that much, or might even remain the same as usual. As for my parents, I think it is going to discourage them from using computers even more because they are so used to the traditional way. The same would apply to my friends unless they are computer geeks like me.
								<br>Lastly, about Behavioral Analytics, it depends on what app I am using, to say the least. About the Facebook ads, they are relatively bad in my view. They do not seem to match any of the topics I want or search, and sometimes they are flat out adware or malware. However, YouTube recommendations work smoothly for me. It recommends just the right topic, and as a matter of fact, I learned a lot of things related to computers and networking through these recommendations. I even got to know a lot of quality computer-related channels like Computerphile, Numberphile, freeCodeCamp, etc. Overall, it is most useful for me, but I am not sure if it is for my relatives and friends. They do not seem to care much about it, but if they do, I am guessing that they might feel the same as me.
